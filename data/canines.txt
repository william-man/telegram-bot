Canines are a group of carnivorous mammals belonging to the family Canidae. This family includes domestic dogs, wolves, foxes, coyotes, and jackals.

Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are the most widely kept pets in the world and are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and trainability. Dogs have been bred for thousands of years to perform a variety of tasks such as herding, hunting, guarding, and companionship.

Wolves (Canis lupus) are the largest members of the canine family. They are social animals that live and hunt in packs, and are native to many parts of the Northern Hemisphere.

Foxes are smaller members of the canine family, known for their bushy tails and adaptability to urban and rural environments. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the most widespread species of fox.

Coyotes (Canis latrans) are native to North America and are highly adaptable, living in deserts, forests, mountains, and urban areas.

Canines typically have strong jaws, sharp teeth, and excellent senses of smell and hearing. Most are omnivorous, though their diets may vary depending on species and environment.

Canines communicate using vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.
