Felines are members of the family Felidae, a group of carnivorous mammals that includes domestic cats, lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, and other wild cats.

Domestic cats (Felis catus) are one of the most popular pets worldwide. Known for their independence, agility, and hunting instincts, cats have been associated with humans for thousands of years. They are skilled predators, often used to control rodent populations.

Lions (Panthera leo) are social big cats that live in groups called prides. Native to parts of Africa and India, lions are known for their strength, loud roars, and male manes. They are apex predators and primarily hunt large herbivores.

Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest of all wild cats. Solitary by nature, they are native to Asia and are known for their powerful build and distinctive striped fur. Tigers are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.

Leopards (Panthera pardus) are highly adaptable big cats found in Africa and Asia. They are solitary, strong climbers, and capable of hunting both on the ground and in trees.

Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are the fastest land animals, capable of sprinting up to 70 mph (113 km/h). Unlike other big cats, cheetahs cannot roar and are known for their speed and agility rather than strength.

Felines typically have retractable claws, keen eyesight (especially in low light), and a strong sense of hearing. Most are obligate carnivores, relying entirely on meat for nutrition.

Communication in felines includes vocalizations (such as purring, growling, and hissing), body language, and scent marking.
