Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific location. It includes phenomena such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloudiness, and atmospheric pressure.

Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold the atmosphere is, typically measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. It is influenced by sunlight, latitude, altitude, and the time of year.

Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity can make temperatures feel warmer, while low humidity often feels cooler and drier.

Precipitation includes any form of water that falls from the sky, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. It is caused by the condensation of moisture in the atmosphere.

Wind is the movement of air caused by differences in atmospheric pressure. Wind can affect temperature, humidity, and the distribution of weather systems.

Clouds form when moist air rises and cools, causing water vapor to condense into tiny droplets. Different types of clouds (like cumulus, stratus, and cirrus) indicate different weather patterns.

Atmospheric pressure, or barometric pressure, is the force exerted by the weight of the air above a given point. High pressure usually brings fair weather, while low pressure often leads to storms or precipitation.

Weather forecasts are predictions based on data from satellites, weather stations, and computer models. Forecasts typically include temperature highs and lows, expected precipitation, and wind speeds.

The difference between weather and climate is that weather is short-term and localized, while climate describes long-term patterns over decades or centuries.
